I will show you a question, a list of claims, and reference links relevant to the question and claims. All the claims are extracted from an answer to the question. Your task is to assess whether each claim contains factual errors or not with the help of the reference links.

Please generate using the following format:
Answer: List the ids of the claims with errors (separated by commas). Please only output the ids, no more details. If all the claims are correct, output "ALL_CORRECT".
