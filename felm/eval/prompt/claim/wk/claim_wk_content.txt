I will show you a question, a list of claims, and a reference doc relevant to the question and claims. All the claims are extracted from an answer to the question. Your task is to assess whether each claim contains factual errors or not with the help of the reference doc.

Please generate using the following format:
Answer: List the ids of the claims with errors (separated by commas). Please only output the ids, no more details. If all the claims are correct, output "ALL_CORRECT".

Here is one example:
Question: What is the total number of nuclear power plants worldwide?

4. The highest number of reactors is in the United States.
5. France has the second-highest number of reactors.
6. China has a significant number of reactors.
7. Japan has a significant number of reactors.

Reference doc:
Nuclear power plants operate in 32 countries and generate about a tenth of the world's electricity.[1] Most are in Europe, North America, East Asia and South Asia. The United States is the largest producer of nuclear power, while France has the largest share of electricity generated by nuclear power, at about 70%.[2] China has the fastest growing nuclear power programme with 16 new reactors under construction, followed by India, which has 8 under construction.[3]. As of May 2023, there are 410 operable power reactors in the world, with a combined electrical capacity of 368.6 GW.
