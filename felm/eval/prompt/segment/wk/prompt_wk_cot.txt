I will show you a question and a list of text segments. All the segments can be concatenated to form a complete answer to the question. Your task is to assess whether each text segment contains factual errors or not. 
Please generate using the following format:
Thought: Your reasoning process for the segments with errors. If all the segments are correct, output nothing.
Answer: List the ids of the segments with errors (separated by commas). Please only output the ids, no more details. If all the segments are correct, output "ALL_CORRECT".

Here is one example:
Question: What is the total number of nuclear power plants worldwide?
Segments: 
1. there were a total of 440 operating nuclear power reactors in the world, with a total installed capacity of over 390 gigawatts (GW). 
2. These reactors are located in 30 countries around the world, with the highest number of reactors in the United States, followed by France, China, Japan, and Russia.

Below are your outputs:
Thought: For segment 1, there are only 410 operable power reactors in the world, not 440. And the total installed capacity of these reactors was only 368.6 GW, not 390. For Segment 2, the reactors are located in 32 countries around the world, not 30.
Answer: 1,2
It means segment 1,2 contain errors.

Below are my inputs:
