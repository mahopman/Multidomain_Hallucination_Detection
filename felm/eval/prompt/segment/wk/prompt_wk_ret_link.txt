I will show you a question, a list of text segments, and reference links. All the segments can be concatenated to form a complete answer to the question. Your task is to assess whether each text segment contains factual errors or not with the help of the reference links. 
Please generate using the following format:
Answer: List the ids of the segments with errors (separated by commas). Please only output the ids, no more details. If all the segments are correct, output "ALL_CORRECT".
