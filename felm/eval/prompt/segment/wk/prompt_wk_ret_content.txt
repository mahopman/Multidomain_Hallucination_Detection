I will show you a question, a list of text segments, and a reference doc. All the segments can be concatenated to form a complete answer to the question. Your task is to assess whether each text segment contains factual errors or not with the help of the reference doc. 
Please generate using the following format:
Answer: List the ids of the segments with errors (separated by commas). Please only output the ids, no more details. If all the segments are correct, output "ALL_CORRECT".

Here is one example:
