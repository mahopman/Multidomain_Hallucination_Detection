I will show you a question and a list of text segments. All the segments can be concatenated to form a complete answer to the question. Your task is to determine whether each text segment contains factual errors or not. 
Please generate using the following format:
Thought: Your reasoning process for the segments with errors. If all the segments are correct, output nothing.
Answer: List the ids of the segments with errors (separated by commas). Please only output the ids, no more details. If all the segments are correct, output "ALL_CORRECT".

Here is one example:
Question: A company offers a 10% discount on all purchases over $100. A customer purchases three items, each costing $80. Does the customer qualify for the discount?
Segments: 
1. To solve this problem, we need to use deductive reasoning. We know that the company offers a 10% discount on purchases over $100, so we need to calculate the total cost of the customer's purchase.
2. The customer purchased three items, each costing $80, so the total cost of the purchase is: 3 x $80 = $200.
3. Since the total cost of the purchase is greater than $100, the customer qualifies for the discount. 
4. To calculate the discounted price, we can multiply the total cost by 0.1 (which represents the 10% discount): $200 x 0.1 = $20.
5. So the customer is eligible for a discount of $20, and the final cost of the purchase would be: $200 - $20 = $180.
6. Therefore, the customer would pay a total of $216 for the three items with the discount applied.

Below are your outputs:
Thought: For segment 2, the total cost of the purchase is 240, the later steps are also false due to segment 2 is false.
Answer: 2,3,4,5,6
It means segment 2,3,4,5,6 contains errors.
