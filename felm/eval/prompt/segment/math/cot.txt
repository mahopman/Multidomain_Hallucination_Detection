I will show you a question and a list of text segments. All the segments can be concatenated to form a complete answer to the question. Your task is to assess whether each text segment contains errors or not. 
Please generate using the following format:
Thought: Your reasoning process for the segments with errors. If all the segments are correct, output nothing.
Answer: List the ids of the segments with errors (separated by commas). Please only output the ids, no more details. If all the segments are correct, output "ALL_CORRECT".

Here is one example:
Question: 8923164*7236571?
Segments: 
1. The product of 8923164 and 7236571 is: 6,461,216,222,844
2. So, 8923164 multiplied by 7236571 is equal to 6,461,216,222,844.

Below are your outputs:
