I will show you a question and a list of text segments. All the segments can be concatenated to form a complete answer to the question. Your task is to assess whether each text segment contains factual errors or not. 
Please generate using the following format:
Thought: Your reasoning process for the segments with errors. If all the segments are correct, output nothing.
Answer: List the ids of the segments with errors (separated by commas). Please only output the ids, no more details. If all the segments are correct, output "ALL_CORRECT".

Here is one example:
Question: What is the diffusion model in computer science?
Segments: 
1. In computer science, the diffusion model is a mathematical model used to simulate the spread of information or data through a network or system. 
2. It is often used to study phenomena such as the spread of viruses, the adoption of new technologies, or the dissemination of information in social networks.

Below are your outputs:
Thought:  For Segment 1, diffusion model is a kind of neural network. For Segment 2, The diffusion model is used to generate images.
Answer: 1,2
It means segment 1,2 contain errors.

Below are my inputs:
